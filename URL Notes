 <---- QUERY STRINGS IN URL---->
 a query string is the part of a URL (Uniform Resource Locater) after the question mark (?).
 It is meant to send small amounts of information to the server via the url.
 Eg:-https://stackabuse.com/?page=2&limit=3
 Your query parameters can be retrieved from the query object on the request object sent to your route. 
 It is in the form of an object in which you can directly access the query parameters you care about. 
 In this case Express handles all of the URL parsing for you and exposes the retrieved parameters as this object.
 
 <------Extracting Route Parameters----->
In any web application another common way to structure your URLs is to place information within the actual URL path, which are simply called route parameters in Express.
We can use these to structure web pages by information/data, which are especially useful in REST APIs.

Extracting these route parameters is similar to the query parameters. 
All we do is take the req object and retrieve our params from the params object. 

// Route to return all articles with a given tag
app.get('/tag/:id', async function(req, res) {
    
    // Retrieve the tag from our URL path
    var id = req.params.id;

    let articles = await Article.findAll({tag: id}).exec();

    res.render('tag', {
        articles: articles
    });
});
First thing to notice is that we tell Express that our route is /tag/:id, where :id is a placeholder for anything.
It could be a string or a number. So whatever is passed in that part of the path is set as the id parameter.

If we were to navigate to the URL https://stackabuse.com/tag/node then id would be node, and we'd get a bunch of articles that have the node tag on them. 
And req.params in this case would be {id: 'node'}, just like the query object.

As you can see, we again just take our parameter directly from an object contained within the request object.


<------ Conclusion ------>
In this article I presented ways to extract both the query string parameters and route path parameters a URL in the Express web framework. 
Here is a quick recap of how to extract the parameters we talked about:

req.query: directly access the parsed query string parameters
req.params: directly access the parsed route parameters from the path
While the actual act of retrieving this data is very simple, understanding where this info comes from and what it is can be confusing for some beginners. 
Hopefully this article cleared some things up for you. Feel free to let us know in the comments if there is anything that is unclear.
